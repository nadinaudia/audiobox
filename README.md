### Generasi GIGIH â€” Final Project

# [![](./public/favicon.svg)]() Audiobox - Find tracks and create the Playlist you love

_Live Production: [audiobox.errbint.net](https://audiobox.errbint.net)_

A React-based web application that utilizes Spotify Web-API at its finest. You can create, edit and manage playlists in your library, explore featured playlists and follow them. There's also a built-in mini-player to listen to a preview of the tracks. And it's all integrated into Spotify!

## Core Feature (as per the Requirements)

### Creating Playlist

You can create a playlist at `/create` after logging in. First, you should search tracks, see their details and add/remove them to the cart, then you should fill up the title (minimal 10 char), description and click submit. Should you successfully create your playlist, you will see a pop-up that will redirect you to the `/playlist/:playlist_id` page to see the result.

## Extra Feature

### Library

You can see all the playlists you have in the `/library`, be it your own or the public playlist you've followed. You can edit the playlist (if you owned them) by changing the title, description, and tracks. You can also remove any playlist from your library.

### Playlist Manager

Open any playlist in the library and you'll see their dedicated page at `playlist/:playlist_id` where you can do some actions like editing them and reselecting the tracks.

### Explore

Spotify provides you with a highly curated playlist that is featured on the `/explore` page. You can eventually meet playlists that match your taste and add them to your library. You can find a nice-looking carousel of track cards on this page to help you discover better.

### Charts

There's also a sub-page of `/explore?tab=charts` where you can see the daily or weekly global/local track ranking that will keep you updated!

### Music Player

Yes! it's a feature to let you listen to the preview of the tracks you love, you can click the play button on the track or even play the whole playlist continuously in their order. If you want to listen to the full version, there's also a link provided in the mini-player (bottom-left) that will redirect you to the Spotify App.

### History

After you used the Music Player feature, all the tracks you've listened to will be listed under the `/history` page. You can also see the information about how long ago was the track played and then you can also re-play them all.

#### The decision to change bundler from Webpack to Vite

All about performance. Vite bundler is blazing fast utilizing native ESM and ESbuild which is written in Go and Vite can pre-bundle dependencies 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers. This project is built with a Create-react-app set up on top of a new bundler, Vite.

#### Data Fetching with SWR

Managing data fetching is uneasy with all the manual processes of data passing-updating. SWR handled it all out of the box with a real-time experience and better performance, leading to a fast and nice user experience. SWR created a server-caching which gives us a better networking efficiency. SWR can also be a custom Hook that acts almost like global state management.

#### Vitest as Jest replacement

Still about performance, built on top of the vite technologies. Vitest syntaxes are as same as Jest, but the performance is greatly different. Vitest can be integrated easily with the other testing library such as React Testing Library and MSW

#### Deployed on Vercel with Custom Domain

You can visit it at `audiobox.errbint.net`, this project is deployed on Vercel with just Hobby Plan and I set up my own domain errbint.net and later set Audiobox to be the subdomain. The development branch can also be visited at `dev.audiobox.errbint.net`
